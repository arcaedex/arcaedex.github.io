        <h1>Documenting my Choice</h1>
        <p>I implemented the theme option, both because it seems most relevant to what
            I want to pursue with my own website design, and because it's what we did in class.
            This means users can personalize their experience more, particularly if they don't 
            do well with bright or dim lights. I'm storing a user's theme choice.
        </p>

        <h1>Individual Reflection</h1>
        <p>I discovered that I would really prefer my text to appropriately scale, now, and
            I'm still not entirely sure how to implement that but I didn't even know that was a thing
            I could do before. Which seems silly in hindsight of course, but it would be so helpful.
            My localstorage feature better lets users choose if they want a brighter theme or dimmer theme 
            and this just seems nice overall to have. I didn't really know even themes could be nefarious,
            but I was aware that many websites these days collect so much data. It seems like every website I 
            go on these days won't let you opt out of cookies. For my community I think my ants would 
            be very worried about what data can or cannot be used against them because ants are always at war.
        </p>
        <p>Code snippet: inspect me. I store theme choice, which is important for customization of experience, and the user can press the button to change their theme.</p>
    </div>

<script>
//button
let btn = document.querySelector('#theme').addEventListener('click',theme);

function theme(){
    //console.log("theme works");
    let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('userTheme')
    setTheme(currentTheme);
}

// Save user's theme choice
function setTheme(theme) {
    let inTheme = theme;
    if(inTheme=='dark') {
        theme = 'light';
    } else {
        theme = 'dark';
    }
    localStorage.setItem('userTheme', theme);
    document.body.className = theme;
}

// Load saved theme on page load
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('userTheme') || 'light';
    document.body.className = savedTheme;
});
</script>
</body>
