        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I joined CU Boulder in the Program of Exploratory Studies before switching to Media Production.
            Initially I wanted to go for the immersive concentration focus but as I went I became 
            more interested in the Integrated Focus which would better let me pursue my ideal projects. I'm now
            in my first semester of my senior year!
