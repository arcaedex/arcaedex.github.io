        <div class="alert-post"><b>REFLECTION!</b> 10-14-2025: For this assignment I did end up restarting from scratch because the previous version had become such a tangle that trying to optimize it was demoralizing and it was also Ugly. So basically I’ve got a new shiny website for ants. Unfortunately ants can’t use the internet quite yet so I’ve just got a website for ant enthusiasts or people who pretend to be ants in a colony, which crops up surprisingly often (see: pretend-to-be-ants-in-a-colony facebook group). It’s also something I’d like to tote around as one of my first websites for my friends. I implemented a filter function on my resources page in order to filter between map sites and document sites, and I also implemented a name input box that greets the user via continuous storage space. I did these things because they sounded interesting and stuff I’d gotten to scratch at the surface of previously in a recitation. For my community the filter function gives insight into what a particular link will contain, and the name entry is for personality because the group that inspired this website is all about the fun details of stuff. If I’m making a website for a goofy group of people it’s going to have goofy elements. My site has a privacy notice that is ever-present in the footer and explains what data is collected and how it gets used and also sets up button engagement rules. I’m going to be honest with you I also intended to have a button that let the user clear the data they had accrued but I could not for the life of me figure out why implementing that button would break the theme. And it was only a button so I just scrapped it (it works in my earlier iteration of the community website, but for whatever reason it breaks here). I put a lot of effort into making sure my colors contrasted enough to fit the accessibility criteria on both theme versions. I cleaned up statement errors by testing in the validator and checking the inspect developer console. I think the most challenging thing was starting over from scratch and it necessitated an extension request but I think it looks a lot better. It felt better to work with because I set myself up with better organization tools via comments in my code and sketching out the visuals of the website before starting. I also did a lot more pseudo code so I didn’t go off on weird winding tangents as much. I think I got a lot better at this sort of organization in addition to becoming more familiar with the code I was writing. As a side note I DEFINITELY got better at employing the input box and using local storage there to save the name. If I had more time and resources I would implement more on the resources and alerts pages, as well as trying to revisit whatever the error was with the clearing data button.</div>
