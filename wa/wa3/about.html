                Hello! I'm Alex and this is my portfolio website. I'm a senior in Media Production at CU Boulder, with a minor in Creative Tech & Design. I'm also a groundskeeper right now!

                I like digital art, both making it myself and analyzing others' work. I've always been a fan of playing computer games, like Rain World, Mouthwashing, and Ultrakill. Additionally I'm very into speculative biology and stories told through pieces and puzzles. Outside of all that, I've also been making experimental physical art pieces, coding, photography, and poetry.

            <p>
                I plan to make a photography and art book for my capstone at CU Boulder, so stay tuned!
