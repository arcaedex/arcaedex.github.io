                Hello! I'm Alex and this is my portfolio website. I'm a senior in Media Production at CU Boulder, with a minor in Creative Tech & Design. I'm also a groundskeeper right now!

                I like digital art, both making it myself and analyzing others' work.

                I plan to make a photography book for my capstone at CU Boulder, so stay tuned :)
