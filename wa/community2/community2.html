    <h1>ANTS LOVE NETWORKS!</h1>
    <p> Typically tunnel networks. But given the power of the internet they could do wonders... this website is a welcome spot for when they do.
    Keeping up with the weather is all the more important when you're the size of a raindrop- access to this information could save lives.
    Alerts on predators, food sightings, and colony data could all benefit ants immensely.

    <h1>For The Big Ant That Grades Homework:</h1>
    <p>DOCUMENTATION! You may have noticed the text is kind of small... it was difficult to figure out how to accomodate for ants while still being legible for people.
    It's also fairly important to keep the website keyboard friendly because while ants might get small keyboards, I don't think they have small mice.
    Based on testing, I wanted the hamburger menu to be a kebab instead for discernability, and when I have more text I want to figure out how to change the menu flexbox to flex a little differently but I'm not sure how yet.
