                Hello! I'm Alex and this is my portfolio website. I'm a senior in Media Production at CU Boulder, with a minor in Creative Tech & Design. I'm also a groundskeeper right now!

                I like digital art, both making it myself and analyzing others' work. I've always been a fan of playing computer games, like Rain World, Mouthwashing, and Ultrakill. Additionally I'm very into speculative biology and stories told through pieces and puzzles. Outside of all that, I've also been making experimental physical art pieces, coding, photography, and poetry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan to make a photography and art book for my capstone at CU Boulder, so stay tuned!

                If you're here to grade me: Hi! For the Week 4 assignment: I evaluated Skyla in-class and she evaluated me.
                My feedback on her website was that I thought her colors were pretty cool and did well for setting up a vibe while also keeping her content coherent. However, her text felt really small to me so I mentioned that she might make it bigger.
                Her feedback for my website consisted of doublechecking my colors and their accessibility (particularly because I was doing some poor contrast blue on purple nonsense as a placeholder) but also that I had some real good visual hierarchy.
                In the future, I'd like to figure out how to give hovertext on my images for accessibility and because it's something I always like seeing in other websites!
